web-light-themes
================

This project transforms the Ubuntu-Ambiance-Theme to a browser compatible css-format,
so with the generated css you can create webapps with the look like nativ Ubuntu apps.

If you want to use the finish css, you do not need compile it by self, you can use the [finished generated css-file](https://raw.github.com/JumpLink/web-light-themes/master/result/Ambiance.css) of this repository.
